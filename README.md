# Airbnb-Dashboard

This is an interactive Tableau dashboard I built to analyze Airbnb listings and trends. This dashboard enables users to explore key insights such as pricing trends, availability, occupancy rates, and location-based performance in a dynamic, visual format.

🔍 Key Highlights:

Pricing Insights: Visualize how average prices vary across neighborhoods and property types.
Occupancy Trends: Track booking patterns and availability rates.
Geospatial Analysis: Leverage map visualizations to identify top-performing areas.
User Interaction: Filter listings based on city, price range, property type, and review scores.

🎯 This project demonstrates the power of data visualization and how actionable insights can be drawn from raw datasets to help hosts, travelers, or analysts make data-driven decisions.

🔗 Why it matters: Interactive dashboards make complex data simple, accessible, and impactful for decision-making.
